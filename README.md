# Bushido

*The Spirit of the Samurai*

[![][logo]][logo-large]


## Description

These are some notes taken from the book 
[Bushido: The Spirit of the Samurai][bushido-book], by Inazo Nitobe, from
Shambhala Publications.


## Background

As a long-time student of various Asian philosophies, Bushido has been in my
consciousness for much of my adult life. About the time my professional life
took a turn towards management I had also started taking [kendo][kendo] lessons.
I mention these together, since both of these things caused me to take a much
deeper look at Bushido than I had done previously. My respect for this 
particular way of the warrior only grew more with reading and practice. With
regard to my management style, it had a profound impact and allowed me to grow
as a leader to a certain degree, but much more as a dedicated servant and
protector of my direct reports, and ultimately, the best interests of the 
companies I worked for -- since I do believe without any doubt that the most
valuable asset in any organization is the happiness of and support for its
members.

Eventually the political landscape of the tech companies in the Bay Area and
Silicon Valley drove me away. Having tired from the constant views ranging 
from petty self-interest to gross abuses of power and having come to the 
disappointing realization that I could no longer continue helping the cause
with my minute efforts, I set management aside and returned to the world
of the technical contributor. I am sad to report that I haven't regretted that
once. I do completely adore writing code -- and this is something I continued
to do on my own time -- that is not the cause of the sadness. Rather it is
simply due to the fact that I have seen no evidence that companies are trending
away (even as an abstract, statistical whole) from destructive behaviours. I
see no evidence that Bushido or any similar code of conduct could find fertile
ground in which it might flourish.

Even still, I cannot help but continue reading and contemplating, going over
scenarios, finding new applications for this way of life. So, when I saw this
sweet little book (measuring just 11x18cm) in a Sioux Falls, SD neighborhood
bookstore, I couldn't resist. Yet the risk of simply collecting dust is too
high, so I must do something with it lest it fade to insignificance.

So here we are, writing some notes and musing together :-)


## The Author

[Inazo Nitobe][nitobe], born in 1862, was from what is now Iwate Prefecture in
Japan where his father was a retainer to the local daimy≈ç of the Nambu clan. 
Nitobe was an agricultural economist, author, educator, diplomat, and 
politician. He became one of the Under-Secretaries General in the League of
Nations upon is creation in 1920 where he was a founding member of the 
International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (under the United Nations,
this became UNESCO). When Japan withdrew from the League in March of 1933,
Nitobe was devastated. He died later that year.


## The Book

*Bushido* was published in 1900 and was one of the first books written in 
English on the subject of the ethics of samurai in particular and Japanese
culture in general. Initially criticized, the book eventually (after over 80
years) became quite popular in Japan.


## Notes

I've taken some notes while reading and reflecting upon this book. These notes
are not reflections on what I would do to apply these principles as a manager;
nor are they models for becoming a better engineer. At the same time, they are
also both. More clearly stated, I've taken notes on the phrases, sentiments, and
views of Nitobe that I felt captured the aspects of Bushido most applicable to
an individual simply striving to make each moment count, to not waste any
opportunity for growth, for practicing lessons previously learned.
